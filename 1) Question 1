Question 1) Implement the Binary search algorithm regarded as a fast search algorithm with run-time
            complexity of ÎŸ(log n) in comparison to the Linear Search.

Answer 3) 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;

    int arr[n];   
    cout << "Elements in sorted order:\n";
    for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        cin >> arr[i];
  
    int a;
    cout << "Enter element to search: ";
    cin >> a;

    int low=0, high=n-1, mid, found=-1;

    while (low <= high) {
        mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == a) {
            found = mid;
            break;
        } else if(arr[mid]<a) {
            low=mid+1;
        } else {
            high=mid-1;
        }
    }
    if (found != -1)
        cout << "Element found at index " << found << endl;
    else
        cout << "Element not found." << endl;
        return 0;
}
